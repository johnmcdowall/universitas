    group_documents:
      tip: Group document senders
      tip_text: "Each group document has a sender, which was the member who originally shared it with the group. Keeping track of these more active members might be a good idea."
      tip2: Group document actions
      tip2_text: "On the group document tables, you can quickly accept/remove a document, edit its module or check out its sender through the little action icons on the right."
      tip3: Adding group documents

      tip3: Sharing documents with a group
      tip3_text: "To share documents you already own, use the search box to find the specific documents you want to share and click the '+' icon. After you're done, select the target group module (or leave it blank if you want) and click 'Save'. On the other hand, if you want to upload a new document on the fly, click the 'Create' button and fill out the form. On both cases, the document will be sent to the group leader for approval."
    registrations:
      tip: Importance of a real e-mail address
      tip_text: "Make sure you supply your real e-mail address so that we can send account recovery instructions, which could happen case you forget your password, or if your chosen sign in option (Facebook or Twitter) token expires."
      tip2: Import personal data from Twitter/Facebook
      tip2_text: "You can import your personal data from Twitter/Facebook like your picture, location, bio, e-mail and website by adding them as sign in options. Links to your profiles in these services will also be added automatically."
    user_documents:
      tip: About Uploaded Documents
      tip_text: "As a document's original uploader, only you can update it, but keep in mind that documents you have uploaded could have been shared across different users and groups, so avoid editing it too drastically for the sake of consistency."
    users:
      tip: Following users
      tip_text: "After following a user, you will receive updates regarding actions about that user such as when he/she adds a document, joins a group, updates status, etc."
      tip2: Other sign in options
      tip2_text: "You can edit your profile and add other sign in options like Facebook or Twitter, making signing in as easy as clicking the correspondent service icon in the navigation bar."
    forums:
